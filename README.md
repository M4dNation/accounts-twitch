## Install

`meteor add m4dnation:accounts-twitch`

## About

A login service for Twitch.

## Usage

Once the package is added to your Meteor project, you need to configure the Twitch integration with the information from your Twitch application.  
More information are available in the [documentation](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/).  
Here is an exemple of configuration:

```js
// In any file loaded server side prior to any login attempt
ServiceConfiguration.configurations.upsert(
  { service: "twitch" },
  {
    $set: {
      loginStyle: "popup",
      clientId: "my-twitch-client-id",
      redirectUri: "my-redirect-uri",
      secret: "my-twitch-client-secret",
    },
  }
);

// In a client side file
Meteor.loginWithTwitch({ requestPermissions: ["user:read:email"] }, err => {
  // do something here if any error, or after login if no error
});
```
